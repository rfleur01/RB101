# Yes, there is a difference. While both methods have the same return value, in the first implementation, the input argument called buffer will be modified and will end up being changed after rolling_buffer1 returns. That is, the caller will have the input array that they pass in be different once the call returns. In the other implementation, rolling_buffer2 will not alter the caller's input argument.
