=begin

Just to clarify, if you see ! or ? at the end of the method, it's actually part of the method name, and not Ruby syntax. Therefore, you really don't know what the method is doing, even if it ends in those characters -- it depends on the method implementation. The other uses are actual Ruby syntax:

!= means "not equals"
? : is the ternary operator for if...else
!!<some object> is used to turn any object into their boolean equivalent. (Try it in irb)
!<some object> is used to turn any object into the opposite of their boolean equivalent, just like the above, but opposite.
